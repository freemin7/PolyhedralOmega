# PolyhedralOmega
The PolyhedralOmega algorithm can be used to calculate a Rational Function Solution of Linear Diophantine System. Given some integer matrix A and some fitting integer vector b a rational function is returned which represents the set of all natural number valued vectors x such that Axâ‰¥b.
